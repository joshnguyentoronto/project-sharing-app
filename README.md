### Key Learning:

- React is a very powerful and dynamic tool, but we have to do it "The React Way"
- In React, state management is everything, it's difficult, it's important, and of course "follow the React way"
- Important: know what you are capable of! We are so ambitious about this final project that we put so much hours and effort in it.

---

### Challenges:

- Create a great and fully functional app in only a small amount of time take a lot of effort
- React version 6 required to use Function Component for many feature that Class base Component is more difficult to work with
