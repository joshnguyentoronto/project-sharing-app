### Key Learning:

- React is a very powerful and dynamic tool, but we have to do it "The React Way".
- In React, state and props management is important.
- Component management is the key.

---

### Challenges:

- Creating a fully functional app in a small amount of time takes a lot of effort.
- The newest version of React and React Router required to use functional component for many features, and it makes class based component difficult to work with
